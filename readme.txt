Improves the management of your scheduled Posts.

== Description ==

Better Scheduled Posts improves the management of your scheduled Posts by:

- making them visible on the front end to administrators/contributors
- adding them to the internal link box
- enabling you to push them back by any number of days.

= Front End Visibility =

Does it frustrate you when you schedule a post to publish and you can't see it when you view your website?

Install this plugin and your scheduled Posts will become visible on the front end as if they were already published, but only to administrators/contributors. Your audience doesn't see the posts until the date/time they are scheduled to publish.

= Internal Links =

Does it frustrate you when you're writing a Post and you want to link to another Post that's scheduled but not published yet, and it doesn't show up in the Insert Link box?

Install this plugin and you'll be able to easily add links to scheduled Posts the same way that you add links to published Posts.

= Push Back Posts =

Have you ever scheduled a number of posts to publish, perhaps on successive days, and your plans change and you need to push them all back a day (or number of days)?

Install this plugin and you'll be able to push back all your scheduled Posts by any number of days, all at once instead of one by one.
